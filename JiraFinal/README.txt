This issue tracking app tracks issues reported to a team of developers. 
All issues have a status (open, in progress, done, overdue), type (user story, task, build, test, debug, documentation, etc.) and priority level (red, yellow and green). 
These issues are grouped into issues that need to be done, are currently in progress or are already completed. 
Once an issue is created it is immediately categorized as “to do”. Once the team decides what issues they want to tackle, they are put into a sprint with a start date and a due date. Once the issues in the sprint are completed they are marked as done. 
A user can sign into the Jira which then shows their previous projects, current projects, log out, view all of your current projects, view a specific project and its details, create new projects, create new issues, work on a issue, update your project status, update your issue status, assign a member to an issue, delete your project, delete your issue and quit the jira.
